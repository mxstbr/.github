**Hey, I'm Max! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a JavaScript Engineer from Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ in love with React and Node. I currently work on open source JavaScript tooling at Gatsby. Before that I worked at GitHub (this thing!), who acquired my startup [Spectrum](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum).

If I'm not coding or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/mxstbr), I'm likely brewing coffee on my espresso machine (I'm a [huge specialty coffee geek](https://github.com/mxstbr/ama/issues/46)), exploring the world or skiing.

My drug of choice? Fresh, white powder snow. ðŸ¤™
